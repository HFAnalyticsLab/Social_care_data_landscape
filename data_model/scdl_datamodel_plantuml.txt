note left
  The THF Domain model
  has 6 dimensions at level 1:
  Users, Unpaid Carers, Workforce,
  Services, Providers, Funders.

  ... sub-divided into 34
  dimensions at level 2
  (e.g. User:Demographics)...

  ... and 100 at level 3
  (e.g,User:Demographics:Ethnicity)
  Here we introduce Domain Phase
  (demand, supply, operate, outcome).

entity "domainmodel_measure_map" as dm_msr_map{
  *dm_l3_id
  *msr_id

}

note top
  We created 1,328 mappings from
  the domain model to the measures.
end note

entity "measure" as msr{
  *msr_id

  *msr_name
  msr_section
  msr_table
  *msr_data_url
  *msr_population_or_survey
  msr_survey size
  *msr_min_geo_resolution
  *msr_strength

}

note top
  There are 351 individual measures,
  e.g. "Long Term Gross Current
  Expenditure by Support Setting".
  The population/survey flag and
  geo resolution also contribute
  to the measure strength.

note left
  Identified from major analysis
  reports (e.g. Kings Fund 360)
  we analysed 30 referenced public
  sources (e.g. NHS Digital ASCOF).
  Eight of these attributes
  contribute to measure strength.

The data feed to the visualisation is an inner join across domain_model_l1/2/3,
left outer joined to domainmodel_measure_map (to preserve
dimensions with no measures mapped), inner joined to measure and source.
