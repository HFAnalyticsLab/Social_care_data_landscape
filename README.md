# Mapping the landscape of open data on adult social care in England

#### Project Status: completed March 2020

## Project Description

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the Health Foundation collaborated with researchers from City University London to map and visualise sources of open data across the adult social care pathway. This project aimed to collate information on the availability, timeliness, coverage and quality of public data sources, to match these against stakeholder groups and information requirements. The aim was to create informative visualisations on data availability and gaps to investigate the following in order to raise the profile of adult social care statistics to inform action:

1. What is the extent of the data that are publically available with regards to Adult Social Care
in England?
2. How much can the data tell us about funding and provision of services, the workforce and
unpaid carers who deliver services, and ultimately the users of the services?
3. Do those data suÙÄÅΩciently inform us about the needs, the care system performance and the
outcomes?
4. What can we say about the quality of available data?

## Data source

This study focused on the meta data of available data, not the underlying values of that data itself. We included publicly available data and measured related to adult social care published at regular intervals. 

Data sources were identified through the report listed in the References section and by searching the data archives of organisations including NHS England, NHS Digital, the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England, Skills for Care, the Care Quality Commission, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and the NIH National Institute of Ageing.

## Visualisations 

This interactive, exploratory [visualisation](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/Social_care_data_landscape/blob/master/site/scdl_vis.html) shows our attempt to visualise the complex nature of available measures on adult social care. Individual measures are mapped against the adult social care pathway on three levels with inceasing granularity. At level 1, this consists of the main service and stakeholder groups including users, unpaid carers, workforce, the provided service, providers and funders. Vertical lines  show how measures can be used to explore relationships  between different parts of the social care pathway. Measures are grouped according to whether they relate to demand, supply, operations or outcome and the opacity is based simple scoring algorithm for measure strength based  on population  or survey size, time lag and geographical  resolution. The number of measures related to each parth of the pathway is encoded in the grey background and areas with better data coverage are shown with a lighter background. The visualistion  is interactive and allows the user to zoom and filter to explore groups in more detail and hovering over individual items will bring up a description of the data source.
